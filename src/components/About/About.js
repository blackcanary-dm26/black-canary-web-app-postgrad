                                developed the design for the web app. She created and styled

                                the front-end, but she assisted with some of the server-side
                                javascript code and logic.
                                Emily is a first-degree backbelt and is mildly obsessed with

                                the message alert system.
                                Andi grew up in Idaho and California, and loves dogs, providing

                                database in PostgreSQL. While most of her work was on the server-side,
                                her work with websockets required interaction and preparation with the
